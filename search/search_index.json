It\u2019s made in New South Wales, Australia and was the result of a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2020. Now PIRATE MIDI builds and sells MIDI devices all over the world.</p> <p>The BRIDGE6 can send stacks of MIDI messages through different footswitch press types (Press, Hold, Double-Press etc.) with 100 different banks of switches to scroll through. This means that the 600+ MIDI messages on each bank can be individually assigned across the whole device for a total of more than 60,000 unique messages and controls.</p> <p>To help you connect to a wide variety of music gear, we\u2019ve included two Flexiports of our own design. These \u00bc\u201d (6.35 mm) TRS jacks can be set to whatever mode best suits your setup. From expression pedals to beat sync pulse to switch emulation, you can use this MIDI controller to control devices that don\u2019t even have MIDI!</p> <p>With all settings available to easily edit using the onboard display and menus as well as with the web editor, we hope you\u2019ll agree that this is perfect for performing live or playing at home.</p>"},{"location":"manuals/bridge6/#technical-information","title":"Technical Information","text":""},{"location":"manuals/bridge6/#links-to-downloads","title":"Links to Downloads","text":"<p>User manuals, firmware updates, and other downloads are available at:</p> <ul> <li>https://learn.piratemidi.com</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s important that firmware updates are installed when they are available.
